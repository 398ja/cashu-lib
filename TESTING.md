We describe here our testing strategy and the results of our tests.

# cashu-lib-common
We test the json serialization and deserialization of the classes in the ```cashu-lib-common``` module. We also test the correctness of the classes in the module.

# cashu-lib-crypto
We implement the protocol 00-tests, 01-tests, and 02-tests described [here](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/tree/main/tests).
